# Atlas Labs | Hr Analytics

## Overview

Uncover employee trends at Atlas Labs! This Power BI project dives into their HR data, using visualizations and analysis to understand what makes employees tick. We'll explore factors affecting attrition (employee turnover) to help Atlas Labs develop strategies for keeping their top talent.

## Phases:

### Phase 1 -  Data Acquisition and Exploration (Import & Clean)

1- Import Data: By connecting to the Atlas Labs HR dataset in Power BI.

2- Data Cleaning: Ensure the data is accurate and consistent for analysis.

3- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Get familiar with the data by analyzing basic trends, distributions, and relationships between variables to understand what insights are possible.

### Phase 2 - Data Modeling and DAX
